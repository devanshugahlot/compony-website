                                        <h2><strong>Metaverse and 3D Space</strong></h2>
                                        <p>The word "metaverse " was first used by novelist Neal Stephenson in 1992 with a discussion about lifelike avatars in accurate 3D environments and other virtual reality scenarios. Since that time, many developments
                                            have paved the way for the development of a true metaverse, an online virtual environment that mixes augments reality, virtual reality, 3D holographic avatars, video, and other means of communication.&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>You will have access to hyper-real other dimensions where you can live in both the actual world and the metaverse simultaneously as metaverse growth continues. There are hints of the metaverse in online gaming universes
                                            like Fortnite, Minecraft, and Roblox, and the companies that created those games want to take part in the development of the metaverse.&nbsp;</p>
                                        <h3><strong>The Metaverse and its Possibilities&nbsp;</strong></h3>
